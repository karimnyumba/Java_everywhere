Each directory contains code examples, explanations, and exercises to help you learn Java programming language. 

## Getting Started
To get started with Java programming, you should start with the [Introduction](./01_introduction) directory. This directory will introduce you to Java programming language and explain the benefits of learning Java. 

After that, you should move on to the [Setup](./02_setup) directory, which will guide you on how to set up your development environment for Java programming. 

Once you have your environment set up, you can move on to the [First Steps](./03_first_steps) directory, which will introduce you to basic concepts such as variables, data types, and operators.
